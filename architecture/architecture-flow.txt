CloudPulse Architecture  

STEP 1:
A static website is hosted using Amazon S3.

STEP 2:
Amazon CloudFront is used to deliver the website globally with low latency and caching.

STEP 3:
Amazon EventBridge is configured to run on a fixed schedule (every 5 minutes).

STEP 4:
EventBridge automatically triggers an AWS Lambda function.

STEP 5:
The Lambda function sends an HTTP request to the website and measures:

Website availability (UP / DOWN)

Response time (latency in milliseconds)

STEP 6:
Each monitoring result is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, including:

Timestamp

Status (UP/DOWN)

Latency value
This enables historical tracking.

STEP 7 (Day 5 – Latency Trend Detection):
Lambda reads recent latency records from DynamoDB and compares:

Recent average latency

Older average latency
to detect performance degradation trends.

STEP 8 (Day 6 – SLA Calculation):
Lambda calculates uptime SLA percentage using stored records:

Uptime SLA = (UP checks / Total checks) × 100


STEP 9 (Day 7 – Smart Alerting):
Lambda analyzes recent results and sends Amazon SNS alerts only when:

The website is DOWN for multiple consecutive checks, or

High latency occurs repeatedly
This avoids noisy alerts.

STEP 10 (Day 8 – Auto-Recovery):
If failures continue beyond a higher threshold:

Lambda automatically triggers a CloudFront cache invalidation

This refreshes content from S3

Recovery actions are logged and notified via SNS
