STEP 1:
A static website is hosted using Amazon S3.

STEP 2:
Amazon EventBridge is configured to run every 5 minutes.

STEP 3:
EventBridge automatically triggers an AWS Lambda function.

STEP 4:
The Lambda function sends an HTTP request to the website and measures:
- Availability (UP/DOWN)
- Response time (latency)

STEP 5:
The monitoring results are stored in Amazon DynamoDB for historical tracking.
