# 🟢 DAY 1 — STATIC WEBSITE HOSTING

### What was done
- Created a static website using HTML and CSS.
- Hosted the website using **Amazon S3**.

### Outcome
- Website accessible publicly.
- Base system to monitor is ready.

---

# 🟢 DAY 2 — EVENT-DRIVEN MONITORING

### What was done
- Created an **AWS Lambda** function.
- Lambda sends HTTP request to the website.
- Measures:
  - HTTP status code
  - Response time (latency)

### Outcome
- Automated website checking logic created.

---

# 🟢 DAY 3 — DATA STORAGE WITH DYNAMODB

### What was done
- Created a DynamoDB table.
- Used:
  - **Partition Key (pk)** → Website identifier
  - **Sort Key (sk)** → Timestamp
- Lambda stores:
  - Status (UP / DOWN)
  - Latency
  - Error (if any)

### Outcome
- Historical monitoring data stored reliably.

---

# 🟢 DAY 4 — AUTOMATION WITH EVENTBRIDGE

### What was done
- Configured Amazon EventBridge.
- Lambda runs automatically every 5 minutes.

### Outcome
- Fully automated monitoring without manual execution.

---

# 🟢 DAY 5 — LATENCY TREND DETECTION

### What was done
- Lambda fetches last 10 latency records from DynamoDB.
- Splits data into:
  - Older latency values
  - Recent latency values
- Calculates average for both.
- Compares averages.

### Logic
If Recent Avg > Older Avg → DEGRADING
Else → NORMAL


### Outcome
- Detects performance degradation **before downtime occurs**.

---

# 🟢 DAY 6 — UPTIME SLA CALCULATION

### What was done
- Lambda reads last 50 monitoring records.
- Counts:
  - Total checks
  - UP checks
- Calculates SLA using:

Uptime % = (UP checks / Total checks) × 100


- Publishes SLA metric to CloudWatch.

### Outcome
- Business-grade uptime percentage calculation.

---

# 🟢 DAY 7 — SMART ALERTING (SNS)

### What was done
- Integrated **Amazon SNS** for alerts.
- Alerts are triggered only when:
  - Website is DOWN for 3 consecutive checks
  - OR latency exceeds threshold repeatedly

### Why this matters
- Avoids alert spam.
- Sends alerts only when issue is real.

### Outcome
- Intelligent, production-like alerting system.

---

# 🟢 DAY 8 — AUTO-RECOVERY (SELF-HEALING)

### What was done
- Added auto-recovery logic.
- If website is DOWN for **7 consecutive checks**:
  - Lambda triggers **CloudFront cache invalidation**
  - Attempts automatic recovery
  - Sends recovery notification via SNS

### Why auto-recovery is needed
- Humans may miss alerts.
- System attempts recovery automatically.
- Reduces downtime without manual intervention.

### Outcome
- Monitoring + Action combined.
- SRE-level self-healing feature implemented.
